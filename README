A script for transferring remote configuration files to an Amlogic TV-BOX running LineageOS-22.2 or later (non-A/B devices only).

Requirements:
* A Linux PC or VM with Linux
* ADB pre-installed on the computer.

How to use:
-----------
Step 1. TV-BOX: Enable "USB debugging", "Rooted debugging", and "ADB over network" under "Developer options".

Step 2. Computer: Start ADB
cd cpremote
adb connect <ip.addr.tv.box>

Step 3. Run the script:
chmod +x cpremote.sh
./cpremote remote.tab1
or
./cpremote remote.tab2
or
./cpremote remote.tab3
or (optional)
./cpremote remote.cfg

Step 4. Choose opt: ​​1 - A remote.tabX file will be downloaded from the device to the current folder, which you can now customize to your needs.
If you already have a pre-made and working remote.tabX file, just copy it into the 'cpremote' folder.

Step 5. Choose opt: ​​2 - The new remote.tabX file will be pushed to the device.

Step 6. Choose opt: ​​3 - A debug mode will be activated, allowing you to test your new remote configuration.
The debug starts with information like:

Loading cfgs:
0. 0xf708,amlogic-remote-1
1. 0xfe01,my-remote-nec

The "custom_code" and "custom_name" of your new remote.tabX file should appear here.
In my example, it was "0xfe01,my-remote-nec".
Just follow the instructions on the screen.
When you are satisfied with the new configuration, exit debug mode by pressing Ctrl+C on your keyboard.

Step 7. Choose opt: ​​4 or 5 - Reboot the device(4) or exit the script(5).

----------------------------------
Opt. 6 (optional) explains itself.
